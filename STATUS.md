3. **3D Transforms** - Interactive perspective shifts
4. **Particle Ambience** - Floating light particles
5. **Premium Typography** - Inter + SF Pro Display

### Color System

```css
--glass: rgba(255,255,255,0.05)        /* Translucent base */
--glass-border: rgba(255,255,255,0.1)  /* Subtle borders */
--gradient-primary: 5-color animation  /* Living gradients */
--glow-primary: rgba(0,179,255,0.5)   /* Cyan glow */
--glow-accent: rgba(138,43,226,0.4)   /* Purple accent */
```

### Motion Design

- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` - Material Design
- **Duration:** 400ms base, 600ms complex
- **Stagger:** 60ms delays for cascading effects
- **Physics:** Custom particle velocity and friction
